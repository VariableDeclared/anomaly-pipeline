# Some notes

The networks are built with layers, using the pytorch framework.

We can tweak parameters of the process, e.g.

- Layers
- Batch size
- Activation functions

##Â Next steps

Take a look at activation functions and their use-cases, play with layers, play with different parameters to understand implications on overall performance of the model.
